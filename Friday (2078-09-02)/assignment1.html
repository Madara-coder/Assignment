        /* Escape sequences:-
                                    An escape sequence refers to a combination of characters beginning with a back slash (\) followed by letters or digits. Escape sequences represent non-printable and special
                                    characters in character and literal strings. As such, they allow users to communicate with a display device or printer by sending non-graphical control characters to specify
                                    actions like question marks and carriage returns.
                                  */
