    ->  Indexes are simply the numbers used to denote the elements of the arrays. They are also called subscripts. <br>
        For eg:- If an array is  const array = [23,44,55,33,44,33,24,44];<br>
        To call out the first element we write array[0] in which 0 is index for the first element of the array.

        document.write(define);
